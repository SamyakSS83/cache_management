- how long does a bus transaction take?

- what is the bus latency?
- what is the bus bandwidth? - 1 transaction at a time
- what is the variable global_cycle?
- add a block bit for a core, to indicate it is still not done processing previous instruction
- figure out how to put bus on hold for 100 cycles, bus put on hold, but how to free it after 100 cycles? 
    - inc the globalcounter by 1 at the end of one iteration through all the cores
- make a function to write back from a cache back to memory
- inc totalBusTransactions accordingly everywhere
- inc miss counts also
- introduce req types on bus, for different cases
